==================
In ex3.py there 8 function:
1) create_list gets strings from the user and return all the string
 in one list.
the function use while loop and append the strings to another list
and stop when the user enter empty string.
2) concat_list receive list of strings and return them as a one string
by using for loop.
3) average recieve numbers and return the sum of them by using for loop
that add the numbers to total list.
4) cyclic receive two lists and check if the list equal in cyclic
formation to the second.
5) histogram receive list of numbers and another number and check the
histogram list of the numbers.
6) prime_factors get one number and return all the prime numbers
 until this number.
7) cartesian receive two list of any type and return the cartesian
 product of them.
8) pairs receive list of numbers and another number and return all
the pairs that the sum of them
equal the the another number.

1. True because this is cyclic formation, that equal the the second list
2. [0,1,1] because it is do histogram list to the lengthe of the 3
3. [0] : because there is not thing like range(2,0),
 and the for loop dont start.
the number (0) continue to the "if" condition and enter to the
condition(0 is not 1!) and then zero append to
the list and the function return this list = [0] !
4.[[0, 2], [0, 2], [1, 1], [1, 1]] : because my function
based in condition that there is no duble numbers in the num_list. my base on
function is to duplicate the num_list and after that remove number from there.
before the function remove the number the function append number,so if there
is double nuber it will append
it twice.
