=  Description:  =
==================
in this file we create and returns values of mathematical function and
operations. this file contain base function like subtraction, addition, compos
and more basic operations between two functions.

also, in this file there is also function that draw the function by using
plot_func (from Graph).

in addition, in this file there is more complicated function:
1. solve - return the solutions of function
2. inverse - this function receive function and return the inverse function of
this function.
3. integral - this function receive function and return the integral of the
function.
4. definite_integral -  this function receive function and return the sum of
the integral (by using riemann method formula)
5. ex11_func_list - returns list with 8 functions that we create with function
we create before.

i discussed with arik stein about "styling"v the composes function in the
last function (ex11_func_list)
