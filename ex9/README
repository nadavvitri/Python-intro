=============================
This program contain 4 classes - Ship, Asteroid, Torpedo and GameRunner,
that together define every object in the game and run the "asteroid game".

about the game:
the user start the game with ship with three lives. at starting there is
asteroids moving in the screen(the default number is 3). user can accelerate
the ship (by press "up") and move the user have (by change the heading of the
ship by press "right" or "left").
torpedoes that he can shot (by press the space bar) the asteroids. if the size
of the asteroid bigger then one the asteroid will split to two new (smaller) 
asteroid.
the game over when user win or lose or he ask to exit (by press "exit" or "Q").
the user win if he destroy all the asteroids in the game.
the user loss if all his three lives ended.

==================
My consideration in this code:
1. the movement of the objects in the game happens in GameRunner. in my opinion
this is a good decision that save "lines of code" and more simple to
understand for other who will see this code (they not need to go to every class
to understand the movement..).
another way - to define movement of each object in his class. the advantage in
that is that the code more "modular" - if someone want"s to change movement
of specific object it"s very simple (in my code you have to write a new code)

2. GameRunner include function that change thing in the objects - there is in
class GameRunner function that change value and thing in object - like new
speed if user want"s to accelerate the ship. in my opinion this is more simple
 to understand, and more connect to the game itself, and not really define
 the object and because that it"s need to be in that class.
 another way - to create a function in the object (like def accelerate that
 change the speed of the ship in class Ship) and then call it GameRunner. the
 advantage in that is that we "save" the object and not "set" things in another
 class (more private and more secure).

3. Simplify the game by create many function - I tried to write many function
in GameRunner class that each of them do one thing - like split the asteroids,
change objects lives, check if the user exit and more. in my opinion this make
the code much more easy to read and "look nicer".
another way - create function but less. write the code to check if user want"s
to exit in "def game_loop". in that way maybe "game_loop" really long, but
you can see and understand step by step the loop of the game, and you not need
to check what every function do (and then go back to the game loop and so on..)
